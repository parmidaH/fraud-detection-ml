## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using supervised machine learning. The workflow includes:

- Data loading and inspection
- Exploratory data analysis and class balancing
- Data preprocessing
- Training multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Model evaluation and selection
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Making predictions on new transactions

## Download the Dataset

To run this project, you need the `creditcard.csv` dataset. Follow these steps:

1. **Download the dataset from Kaggle:**
   
   - Visit [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
   - Click on the **Download** button.
2. **Place the CSV file:**
   
   - After downloading, locate the `creditcard.csv` file on your computer.
   - Move or copy `creditcard.csv` into the root directory of this repository (the same folder as your `.py` and `.ipynb` files).
